# Project: Sign-Up Form
An interactive sign-up form built using HTML and styled with CSS.

Challenges Faced:
- Layout: initially used flexbox, later on adapted using CSS grid for a much simpler layout
- HTML correct element usage; initially using unsuitable elements for certain tasks
- Integrating images/background images into layout without interrupting grid layout
- Correctly partitioning page layout into grids using rectangle shapes (in MS Paint)
